# RemoteControl-Client
This simple all-in-one remote control solution can send batch code, messages, and files to qualified computers over lan. 

* Do not confuse this with the server application

This application allows incoming connections, it does not allow you to connect to other clients

# Notes
Place UsageMonitor.exe in the same folder as RemoteControl-Client.exe for remote tracking.

Any other placement was and never will be supported for security reasons.
